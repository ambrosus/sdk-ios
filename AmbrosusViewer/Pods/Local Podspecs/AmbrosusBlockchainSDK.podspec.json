Fetch the Amber token balance for a given address, or send a signed Amber transaction from one user to another. \n\n### Usage\n\nTo start using the Ambrosus SDK within a Swift file first import it:\n\n```swift\nimport AmbrosusBlockchainSDK\n```\nNow in order to create a new account, you need to use the `AccountsGenerator` to generate your 12 word seed phrase. With that you can start the `AmbrosusBlockchainService` to fetch your Amber token balance, or send signed transactions through the Blockchain.\n\n```swift\nlet service = AmbrosusBlockchainService()\n// Generate a new 12 word seed phrase\nguard let seedPhrase = AccountsGenerator.shared.creationSeedPhraseWord else { return }\n\n/// Start up the Blockchain Service using the new phrase to sign\n/// This service by default is set to test-net so no real Amber tokens will be spent\nservice.start(with: seedPhrase) {\n    guard let address = service.address?.address else { return }\n\n    // Get the balance for the newly generated account\n    service.fetchAmberBalance(address: address) { (balance, error) in\n        guard let balance = balance else {\n            print(error ?? \"Unknown error occured when fetching blockchain balance\")\n            return\n        }\n        // Unwrapped balance now available\n        print(balance)\n    }\n\n    let addressB = \"0x70f7A7C75f0465B8B1e9a3a0398c72f91D08F89C\"\n\n    /// Send a small amount of Amber tokens to another account\n    /// - Note: Unless you replace the seed phrase created at the start with one representing an account\n    /// with Amber tokens, this send will not succeed since new accounts have a 0 token balance\n    service.send(amount: AmberUnits.micro.rawValue, to: addressB, from: address, callback: { (success, error) in\n        guard let success = success else {\n            print(error ?? \"Unknown error occured when sending Amber transaction\")\n            return\n        }\n        print(success)\n    })\n}\n```\n\n[Sample Transactions](https://explorer.ambrosus-test.com/addresses/0x70f7A7C75f0465B8B1e9a3a0398c72f91D08F89C)",
